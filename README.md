# Preface

Just using this as a tool to organize and clarify some ideas.

The goal of this project is to try and find out more about how things work. 

In the context of that goal, if I can get some feedback—-especially critics—-on the current state of my ideas, that would be great. I'm sure my ideas are all stained with some amount of emotional biases and/or assumptions that are just wrong. I think putting ideas out there is the best way to spot those flaws and course correct. 

If you'd like to talk about any of these topics, or any other topics, please reach out!

    Minimum Wage
</a>
    People who support increasing the minimum wage say it‘ll lift low-wage workers out of poverty and ultimately stimulate the economy. People who oppose it say it’ll price low-wage workers out of the workforce and increase prices—making it even harder for people without jobs to support themselves.
