# Preface

Just using this as a tool to organize and clarify some ideas.

If any of my essays have come off offensive, I'll apologize in advance. My intention isn't to be offensive at all, I'm just trying to find out more about how things actually work. 

The intent behind writing down these ideas was to organize/clarify some of my thoughts and possibly get some feedback—-and more importantly, criticism—-on the current state of my ideas. 

I welcome the critcism. I'm sure all my ideas stained with some emotional biases and assumptions that are just wrong. I'm not sure there's a better way to spot those flaws than by welcoming the criticism. 

If you'd like to talk about any of these topics, or any other topics, please reach out!
