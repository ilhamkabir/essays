## Preface

This started off as just a tool to organize and clarify some of my thoughts. But a few papers in, I started realizing I'm learning more about how things work!

I've tried to keep my essays pretty laymen-friendly because I'd love for others to get as excited about these topics! There are a few I felt I couldn't do that in and those papers have the target audience explicity written below them.

I'm sure there are flaws in the current state of most of my ideas. So if you have any feedback (especially critiques) to help me learn those mistakes, I'd appreciate  any time you might have to talk about these topics; or any other topics!

# Essays

## Economics

    Minimum Wage
</a>
    People who support increasing the minimum wage say it‘ll lift low-wage workers out of poverty and ultimately stimulate the economy. People who oppose it say it’ll price low-wage workers out of the workforce and increase prices—making it even harder for people without jobs to support themselves.

    Timeline: Labor Unions from 1768 to Today
</a>
    Although the AFL remained true to its inclusive principles for a few years, skilled white male workers eventually realized the ingress of African American, women, immigrant, and unskilled workers meant less demand for their own labor.

## Finance

    Timeline: Mortgages from 1190 to Today
</a>
    The term “mortgage” is derived from a Law French term used in Britain in the Middle Ages meaning “death pledge”.

    Science vs Pseudo-Science
</a>
    The term "pseudo-science" was coined by a 20th century Austrian philosopher, Karl Popper.

    Billionaire Space Race
</a>
    Even when support was at its peak, when Armstrong and Aldrin took their first steps on the moon, “only a lukewarm 53 percent of the public believed such a momentous historical occasion had been worth the cost.”

- Artifical Intelligence

    - <a href="https://github.com/ilhamkabir/essays/blob/main/Science%20and%20Technology/ai-can-help-us-make-better-decisions.pdf">
        AI Can Help Us Make Better Decisions
    </a>
        Because an AI is just a bunch of “algorithms” (or “models”) layered on top of one another and those algorithm work on explicitly defined rules and principles, we’ll finally need to start having some conversations about the fundamental principles at play — which are easier to separate our emotions from.
