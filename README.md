# Preface

Just using this as a tool to organize and clarify some ideas.

The goal of this project is to try and find out more about how things work. 

In that context, if you have some feedback to offer (especially critiques) on the current state of my ideas, that would be great. I'm sure my ideas are all stained with some amount of emotional biases and/or assumptions that are just wrong. I think putting ideas out there in writing is the best way to spot those flaws and course correct. 

If you'd like to talk about any of these topics, or any other topics, please reach out! 

# Essays

## Economics

    Minimum Wage
</a>
    People who support increasing the minimum wage say it‘ll lift low-wage workers out of poverty and ultimately stimulate the economy. People who oppose it say it’ll price low-wage workers out of the workforce and increase prices—making it even harder for people without jobs to support themselves.

## Finance

    Timeline: Mortgages from 1190 to Today
</a>
    The term “mortgage” is derived from a Law French term used in Britain in the Middle Ages meaning “death pledge”.

## Science and Technology

    A Case for AI to Make All of Our Decisions
</a>
    Because an AI is just a bunch of “algorithms” (or “models”) layered on top of one another and those algorithm work on explicitly defined rules and principles, we’ll finally need to start having some conversations about the fundamental principles at play — which is easier to separate our emotions from.

    Billionaire Space Race
</a>
    Even when support was at its peak, when Armstrong and Aldrin took their first steps on the moon, “only a lukewarm 53 percent of the public believed such a momentous historical occasion had been worth the cost.”
